# pydevenv
Sets up a Python project on Mac OS X with VSCode, git, and Poetry support before creating and pushing the project files up to GitHub with an initial commit.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).
* Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com).
* Once you've cloned the pydevenv repo, add the folder to your PATH.

## Run 
* From a command prompt inside your development folder, type `pydevenv [project_name]`, e.g., `pydevenv helloworld`.
* Once the script finishes, you will have a basic Python project under Git source control, with a copy of your new project on GitHub as well.
